"""WiFi connect handler — drive the post-arrival workflow.

Called by the NetworkManager dispatcher (``99-teslausb-cloud-refresh``)
whenever ``wlan0`` comes up. This is the "car arrived home" trigger:

1. Refresh the read-only mount so the local file watcher sees Tesla's
   latest writes.
2. Trigger a RecentClips → SD-card archive run via the long-lived
   ``gadget_web`` HTTP API. (Daemon threads started in this short-lived
   dispatcher process die when it exits, so we route the work through
   the always-on web service.)
3. Wait — bounded — for the archive run and the indexing-queue drain,
   so cloud sync uploads include the freshly archived/indexed clips.
4. Trigger cloud sync (also via the gadget_web HTTP API, for the same
   daemon-thread-lifetime reason).

Wave 4 PR-F4 (issue #184): the previous Live Event Sync (LES) wake +
drain steps that lived between (3) and (4) have been removed. Live
events are now first-class ``pipeline_queue`` rows enqueued at
``PRIORITY_LIVE_EVENT`` by the file_watcher event.json hook, so the
unified cloud_archive worker picks them up before any bulk catch-up
rows on the very next claim — no separate worker, no separate wake,
no separate drain wait.

Every "wait" step has a hard cap so a hung backend can never make this
script run forever and pile up dispatcher invocations.
