"""Unified pipeline queue helpers — issue #184 Wave 4 — Phase I.1.

This module is the single point of access for the new ``pipeline_queue``
table in ``geodata.db``. The table itself is created by
``mapping_migrations._SCHEMA_SQL`` at v16; this module owns the
producer / consumer / backfill API.

**Phase I.1 only adds the dual-write side.** Legacy producers
(``archive_queue.enqueue_for_archive``, ``indexing_queue_service.
enqueue_for_indexing``, and the cloud-synced-files insertion path)
call into this module's :func:`dual_write_enqueue` after they write
to their own legacy table. Reads remain on the legacy tables — no
behaviour change yet.

Design rules:

* **Best-effort dual-write.** A failure to write to ``pipeline_queue``
  must never fail the legacy enqueue. The legacy queue is the source
  of truth in Phase I.1; pipeline_queue is shadow data being validated.
  All errors are logged at WARNING and swallowed.
* **Idempotent.** The composite unique constraint
  ``(source_path, stage, legacy_table)`` plus ``INSERT OR IGNORE``
  makes repeated dual-writes harmless. Producers that re-enqueue
  (e.g. inotify firing on the same path twice) write at most one
  pipeline_queue row.
* **Cross-DB writes are short-lived connections.** The
  ``cloud_synced_files`` dual-write is the only cross-DB case (cloud
  state is in ``cloud_sync.db``; ``pipeline_queue`` is in
  ``geodata.db``). Each dual-write opens a fresh ``geodata.db``
  connection, writes one row, and closes. No long-lived second
  connection is held alongside the legacy DB connection — that
  would double the connection count and complicate task_coordinator
  semantics.

Public API:

* :data:`STAGE_*` constants — canonical stage names.
* :data:`LEGACY_TABLE_*` constants — canonical legacy table names.
* :data:`PRIORITY_*` constants — canonical priorities.
* :func:`dual_write_enqueue` — producer hook.
* :func:`dual_write_enqueue_many` — batched producer hook.
* :func:`update_pipeline_row` — state-mirror by ``(stage, source_path)``.
* :func:`update_pipeline_row_by_legacy_id` — state-mirror by
  ``(legacy_table, legacy_id)``.
* :func:`claim_next_for_stage` — Wave 4 PR-C reader API; atomic
  pick-and-claim of the next pending row in a stage. Production
  workers wire to this in PR-D.
* :func:`peek_next_for_stage` — Wave 4 PR-C; non-mutating "what's
  next" lookup (parity tests + Settings page).
* :func:`peek_top_n_paths_for_stage` — Wave 4 PR-E; non-mutating
  list of the next N candidate ``source_path`` values in pick order.
  Used by the archive worker's shadow-mode comparison to tolerate
  the documented secondary-sort divergence (``enqueued_at`` vs
  legacy ``expected_mtime``) — a legacy pick is treated as "agreed"
  if it appears anywhere in the pipeline_queue's top-N candidates.
* :func:`ready_count_for_stage` — Wave 4 PR-C; cheap COUNT(*) of
  eligible rows for a stage.
* :func:`recover_stale_claims_pipeline` — Wave 4 PR-D; release
  ``in_progress`` rows whose claimer crashed (claimed_at older
  than threshold). Called once at worker startup.
* :func:`get_recovery_telemetry` — Wave 4 PR-E (#195); read the
  in-memory stale-recovery counters (total recovered, last call
  timestamp, last call count, total call count). Reset on
  ``gadget_web`` restart.
* :func:`pipeline_status` — debug / verification view (counts grouped
  by legacy_table + stage + status), augmented with the
  ``get_recovery_telemetry`` counters.
* :func:`backfill_legacy_queues` — one-time migration helper.

        legacy_table: One of the ``LEGACY_TABLE_*`` constants — which
            old queue this row mirrors.
        legacy_id: Back-pointer to the legacy row's primary key, if

            every legacy row has a corresponding pipeline_queue row.
        priority: Lower = more urgent. Default ``PRIORITY_INDEXING``.

        payload: Queue-specific extras that don't fit the flat schema.

            'event_minute'}`` for LES.
        status: Initial within-stage status. Defaults to ``'pending'``
            for live producer hooks. Backfill paths pass the
            translated legacy status (``'in_progress'`` / ``'done'`` /

    start (e.g. the legacy mirror failed or the dispatch path bailed
    before doing real work). Differs from
    :func:`update_pipeline_row_by_legacy_id` with ``status='pending'``

    confuse forensics (looks like a stuck active claim) and would

    The ``_UPDATE_COLUMNS`` whitelist used by

# These functions let a worker treat ``pipeline_queue`` as the source of

# the archive worker over) ships in PR-D so the pipeline_queue view of
# the world can be observed for one release before any worker depends
# on it.

def claim_next_for_stage(
    *,

    claimed_by: str,

    now: Optional[float] = None,
) -> Optional[Dict[str, Any]]:
    """Atomically claim the next pending row in ``stage``.

    The intended consumer is the unified worker (Wave 4 PR-D). This
    function is purely a read+update on ``pipeline_queue`` — it does
    NOT touch any legacy table. PR-D will compose this with the
    existing legacy ``mark_*`` helpers (which already dual-write back
    via PR-B) so a row's lifecycle stays consistent across both
    tables during the transition.

    Pick order:
      ``WHERE stage = ? AND status = 'pending'
            AND (next_retry_at IS NULL OR next_retry_at <= ?)
       ORDER BY priority ASC, enqueued_at ASC, id ASC LIMIT 1``

    The legacy archive_queue uses ``priority ASC, expected_mtime ASC
    NULLS LAST, id ASC`` — we use ``enqueued_at`` instead because
    ``expected_mtime`` lives in ``payload_json`` and ``json_extract``
    cannot use the ``idx_pipeline_ready`` partial index. In production
    ``enqueued_at`` is a usable proxy: inotify enqueues files in
    arrival order (≈ mtime order from Tesla's POV), and boot catch-up
    enqueues in directory-walk order which is also roughly mtime
    order. Within a single batched enqueue the ordering may differ
    from a strict mtime sort — this is acceptable for PR-C (parity
    with the no-reads-yet baseline). PR-D will add an
    ``expected_mtime REAL`` column or json-extract index if backlog
    catch-up shows the proxy is insufficient.

    Atomicity: the SELECT-then-UPDATE pair runs inside a single
    ``BEGIN IMMEDIATE`` transaction so a concurrent claim from a
    second worker cannot double-pick the same row. The UPDATE adds a
    defensive ``WHERE status = 'pending'`` guard so even if BEGIN
    IMMEDIATE were defeated (unrelated busy-timeout race), the second
    worker's UPDATE returns rowcount=0 and we report "no work" rather
    than handing out a duplicated claim.

    Args:
        stage: One of the ``STAGE_*_PENDING`` constants. Filtering
            on stage is required — this function refuses to operate
            without one (returns ``None``) so a caller bug can't
            sweep the entire queue indiscriminately.
        claimed_by: Operator-readable string for diagnostics.
            Persisted to the row's ``claimed_by`` column AND echoed
            back as the synthesised ``_claimed_by`` key in the
            returned dict (the latter is preserved for backward
            compat with PR-C callers — it equals the persisted
            value). The persistence (added in PR-D / schema v17)
            lets :func:`recover_stale_claims_pipeline` detect rows
            whose claimer crashed and recycle them back to
            ``status='pending'``.
        db_path: Override the geodata.db path (test injection).
        now: Override the "current time" used for ``next_retry_at``
            comparisons AND for the ``claimed_at`` timestamp
            written into the row. **Production code MUST pass
            ``None`` (or omit the argument) so the persisted
            ``claimed_at`` reflects the wall-clock time used by
            :func:`recover_stale_claims_pipeline` to detect stale
            claims.** Hard-coded values are for test injection only.

    Returns:
        A dict snapshot of the claimed row, augmented with two
        synthesised keys:
          * ``payload``: the deserialised ``payload_json`` (or
            ``{}`` when JSON is absent/malformed) so callers don't
            have to ``json.loads`` themselves.
          * ``_claimed_by``: echoed back verbatim from the input
            argument; useful for log/trace correlation.
        ``status`` and ``attempts`` reflect the post-UPDATE values
        (``'in_progress'`` and ``previous + 1`` respectively) so the
        caller sees the same view the DB has after commit.

        Returns ``None`` if the queue is empty for the stage, the
        DB doesn't exist, ``stage`` is empty, or any sqlite error
        fires.

    Mirror of :func:`indexing_queue_service.recover_stale_claims` for

    this, an ``in_progress`` row whose claimer crashed mid-work
    would be orphaned forever (no ``claimed_at`` timeout, no
    recovery mechanism — exactly the gap PR-D closes per issue #193).

    **API note:** unlike ``indexing_queue_service.recover_stale_claims``
    (positional ``db_path, max_age_seconds``), this function is
    **keyword-only** to match the ``claim_next_for_stage`` /

    rest of this module. The reader-API consistency is the priority;
    callers wiring both helpers into a unified worker should pass
    arguments by name.

    The reset:
      * Flips ``status`` from ``'in_progress'`` to ``'pending'``.
      * Clears ``claimed_by`` and ``claimed_at`` (returning the row
        to its pre-claim state).

        ``next_retry_at``, ``last_error``, ``payload_json``,
        ``priority``, ``enqueued_at``, ``source_path``, ``stage``,
        ``legacy_id``, ``legacy_table``. ``attempts`` is preserved
        so a row that has already been attempted N times isn't given
        a free retry — the next ``claim_next_for_stage`` will
        increment to N+1. ``next_retry_at`` is preserved so a
        failure-driven backoff (set by the failed-claim path) still
        fires correctly. ``last_error`` is preserved as a forensic
        breadcrumb so operators can see why the claim was retried.
