"""
Read-only query helpers for the mapping/geo-index DB.

Phase 3c.3 (#100): extracted from ``mapping_service.py`` to keep all
read-only DB access in one place. The Flask blueprints and the cloud
archive service consume these helpers; the indexer itself does not
touch them.

Includes:
  - :func:`get_db_connection` — convenience wrapper around
    :func:`mapping_migrations._init_db`
  - Per-resource queries: ``query_trips``, ``query_trip_route``,
    ``query_events``, ``query_days``, ``query_day_routes``
  - The All-time map endpoint: ``query_all_routes_simplified``
  - Trip-playability: ``playable_trips_for_date`` (with 60s cache)
  - Stats endpoints: ``get_stats``, ``get_driving_stats``,
    ``get_event_chart_data``
  - Polyline gap detection helpers: ``_haversine_m``,
    ``_parse_iso_seconds``, ``_is_gap_between``,
    ``_simplify_polyline_rdp``
  - Filesystem resolution helper: ``_resolve_video_path_on_disk``
  - The 60-second LRU-ish ``_PLAYABLE_TRIPS_CACHE``

Dependency direction (one-way, no cycle):
    Imports ``_init_db`` from ``mapping_migrations`` and a small set
    of runtime helpers from ``mapping_service`` (``_haversine_km``,
    ``_get_worker_status_for_stats``). ``mapping_service`` does NOT
    import anything from this module — none of the indexer code
    paths use these query helpers.

Power-loss safety:
    All queries are SELECT-only and run on the same WAL-mode
    connection that the indexer uses. The 60s
    ``_PLAYABLE_TRIPS_CACHE`` is purely in-memory and rebuilt on
    process restart, so it cannot get out of sync with the DB
    across crashes.

# Polyline gap detection
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# A "gap" between consecutive waypoints means we should NOT draw a
# polyline segment connecting them — the car either wasn't recording
# (Tesla skipped clips during a parking break, or the dashcam was off)
# or the SEI metadata is corrupted. Without gap detection, day-view and
# All-time renderers draw a long straight diagonal across the map from
# one side of the gap to the other (observed bug Apr 26 2026: a 5.8 km
# straight line between two ends of a 6-minute parking break the trip
# detector incorrectly merged into one trip).
#
# Two complementary thresholds, OR'd together — either alone catches
# different real-world failure modes:
#
#   * MAX_GAP_SECONDS = 60 — Tesla front-camera clips are 60 s; a gap
#     longer than that means at least one clip is missing entirely.
#     Catches park-break gaps even when the car barely moved.
#
#   * MAX_GAP_METERS = 250 — Tesla SEI samples at ~1 Hz; even at 80 mph
#     (~36 m/s) consecutive samples are <40 m apart. A jump >250 m
#     between two adjacent waypoints is geographically impossible and
#     usually indicates SEI clock skew across overlapping clips, dropped
#     frames, or interleaved data from a re-indexed late-arriving clip
#     whose timestamps disagree with the rest of the trip.
#
# Both numbers were chosen conservatively: real driving never trips
# them, and any miss would be visible to the user anyway.

    """Return all trip routes (with waypoints) that started on ``date_str``.

    ``date_str`` must be ISO ``YYYY-MM-DD``; the caller is expected
    to validate the format before calling. Day-bucketing is by
    ``substr(start_time, 1, 10)`` — a midnight-spanning trip belongs
    to the day it started, not the day it ended (matches
    :func:`query_days`).

    Returns ``{'trips': [...]}`` where each trip has the same
    metadata fields as :func:`query_trips` plus a ``waypoints`` list
    sorted by ``timestamp ASC`` (with ``id ASC`` as a tiebreaker).
    Sorting by id alone is NOT sufficient: when the v2->v3 trip-
    merge migration combines two originally-separate trips, or when
    a late-arriving video gets indexed into an existing trip (boot
    catch-up scan, file watcher, ArchivedClips re-discovery), the
    new waypoints land with higher ids but their timestamps fall in
    the middle of the existing trip's time range. Walking those in
    id-order draws long straight diagonals across the map. Sorting
    by timestamp restores the true chronological sequence.

    Waypoints are NOT post-processed — callers (i.e. the blueprint)
    are responsible for path normalization (``ArchivedClips`` prefix
    stripping) so the service stays free of presentation concerns.

    Performance: one INNER JOIN; ``idx_trips_day`` (expression index
    on ``substr(start_time, 1, 10)``, schema v8) makes the date filter
    O(log n), then ``idx_waypoints_trip`` covers the join. All trip
    waypoints come back in one round trip, then we group in Python.
    For the worst-case 10-trip day with 500 waypoints each (5000
    rows), this is well under 100 ms on a Pi Zero 2 W.

    Trips with zero waypoints are excluded by the INNER JOIN —
    those wouldn't render on the map anyway. The day card's
    ``trip_count`` from :func:`query_days` may therefore exceed
    ``len(result['trips'])`` if some trips were drift artifacts
    with no GPS — that's surfaced in the UI as expected.

    """Return every indexed trip with shape-aware simplified
    waypoints for the "All time" map overview.

    Each trip's waypoints are simplified using the Ramer-Douglas-
    Peucker algorithm (:func:`_simplify_polyline_rdp`) with
    ``epsilon_m`` as the per-point perpendicular-distance tolerance
    (default 8 m, which is above typical GPS noise yet tight enough
    that any road feature is visually preserved at any zoom). The
    earlier stride-sampling implementation cut straight across road
    curves between kept points, producing visibly wrong polylines on
    long trips — RDP fixes that by keeping the points whose
    perpendicular distance to the simplified path exceeds the
    tolerance, so corners survive and straight stretches collapse
    naturally.

    ``max_points_per_trip`` (default 200) is a safety cap applied
    after RDP; only pathologically zigzag trips would ever hit it.
    Trips below ``min_distance_km`` and trips with fewer than 2
    valid waypoints are excluded — same parity guarantees as
    :func:`query_trips` and :func:`query_day_routes`.

    Returns trips ordered by ``start_time`` DESC. Each trip carries
    enough metadata for the client to drill into the correct day on
    polyline click (``date``) plus the simplified waypoint list
    (only ``lat``, ``lon``, ``speed_mps`` — per-clip drilldown is
    delegated to :func:`query_day_routes` when the user opens a day).

    Performance: one SQL round trip fetches every waypoint for every
    qualifying trip; RDP per trip is O(n log n) on average (O(n^2)
    worst case for pathological zigzags). For a 22-trip / ~10k-
    waypoint database this returns in ~150 ms on a Pi Zero 2 W,
    producing ~30 points per typical trip — substantially fewer
    points than the old stride sampler AND a visually correct
    polyline.
