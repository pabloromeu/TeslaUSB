"""
TeslaUSB Indexing Queue Service.

Owns the persistent SQLite-backed indexing queue. Producers (file watcher,
archive worker, boot catch-up, manual reindex) call ``enqueue_for_indexing``
or ``enqueue_many_for_indexing``; the single ``services.indexing_worker``
consumer drains the queue one file at a time via ``claim_next_queue_item``
and then ``complete_queue_item`` / ``defer_queue_item`` / ``release_claim``
based on the parse outcome.

Phase 3c.1 (#100): extracted from ``mapping_service.py`` to give the queue
API its own home. ``mapping_service`` keeps the indexing core itself
(``_index_video``, ``index_single_file``, ``purge_deleted_videos``,
trip-merge, event-detection, daily stale scan, boot catch-up). The two
files are read-only consumers of each other's public API:

* ``indexing_queue_service`` imports ``canonical_key`` from
  ``mapping_service`` for path → key normalization.
* ``mapping_service`` does NOT import from ``indexing_queue_service``
  (no circular dependency).

Power-loss / Pi Zero 2 W safety:

* Every write goes through ``_open_queue_conn`` which configures
  ``WAL`` + ``synchronous = NORMAL`` + ``busy_timeout = 15000``, so a
  power loss leaves either the prior or the new state — no torn rows.
* ``claim_next_queue_item`` uses ``BEGIN IMMEDIATE`` so two workers
  (or worker + inline producer) can never see the same canonical_key.
* ``complete_queue_item`` / ``release_claim`` / ``defer_queue_item``
  accept a ``(claimed_by, claimed_at)`` owner-guard pair so a stuck
  worker can never mutate a row that's been re-claimed by a fresh
  worker after the stale-claim recovery sweep.
* ``recover_stale_claims`` runs once on worker startup and clears any
  claim older than ``_STALE_CLAIM_SECONDS`` (default 30 min) so a
  crashed worker's locks don't permanently shadow rows.

See ``.github/copilot-instructions.md`` § Video Indexing for the
fairness contract with ``task_coordinator`` and the producer/consumer
discipline that prevents the constantly-flashing "Indexing…" banner.

    Issue #110 — When the archive watchdog's retention prune deletes a
    truncated archive copy, it calls
    :func:`mapping_service.purge_deleted_videos` to clean
    ``indexed_files``, but it does NOT touch ``indexing_queue``.
    Dead-letter rows (``attempts >= _PARSE_ERROR_MAX_ATTEMPTS``) for
    those deleted files would otherwise linger forever, inflating
    ``dead_letter_count`` and showing stale paths in
    :func:`list_dead_letters`.

    Wired into :func:`mapping_service._run_stale_scan_blocking` so it
    runs alongside the existing ``indexed_files`` orphan sweep on the
    same daily cadence (with the 5–10 min initial delay after boot).

    Safety contract:

    * Only ``attempts >= _PARSE_ERROR_MAX_ATTEMPTS`` rows are eligible.
      Live or in-flight rows (``claimed_by IS NOT NULL`` or
      ``attempts < _PARSE_ERROR_MAX_ATTEMPTS``) are NEVER touched —
      the worker's normal ``FILE_MISSING`` outcome handles them on
      next claim.
    * Dead-letter rows whose source file STILL exists are preserved
      (the file might be re-processable after a future fix).
    * One ``os.path.isfile`` per dead-letter row — same shape as the
      ``indexed_files`` stale scan. Orders of magnitude faster than
      re-attempting the parse.
