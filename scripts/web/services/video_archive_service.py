"""Phase 2b/3a compatibility shim for the queue-driven archive subsystem.

The legacy timer-based ``video_archive_service`` was a ~900 LOC module
that owned three responsibilities:

1. Periodically scanning ``RecentClips/`` and copying new files to
   ``ArchivedClips/``.
2. A "smart cleanup" + "proactive retention" + "enforce retention" trio
   that decided which archived files to delete and when.
3. Path-fixup helpers used by the timer loop after each copy.

All three responsibilities now live elsewhere (Phase 2b + Phase 3a):

* **Archiving** — ``services.archive_worker`` (queue-driven, single
  worker thread, dead-letter aware). Producers enqueue via
  ``archive_queue.enqueue_for_archive`` from ``file_watcher_service`` /
  ``mapping_service`` boot scan; the worker drains one file at a time
  with stable-write gating, atomic copy, throttling, and recovery.

* **Retention** — ``services.archive_watchdog`` is the single
  authoritative retention system. ``archive_watchdog.force_prune_now``
  is the synchronous entry point and is exposed at
  ``POST /api/archive/prune_now``. It honors the
  ``cloud_archive.delete_unsynced`` toggle (Phase 1 #95), the
  ``_retention_running`` duplicate-trigger guard (Phase 3a / #91), and
  the "trips are sacred" invariant — it deletes only ``indexed_files``
  rows and NULLs the ``waypoints.video_path`` / ``detected_events.video_path``
  pointer. Existing ``trips`` / ``waypoints`` / ``detected_events``
  records are preserved.

* **Path fixup** — Replaced by re-enqueueing the archived file into
  ``indexing_queue`` (``indexing_queue_service.enqueue_for_indexing``);
  the indexer rewrites the canonical path on its next pass and
  ``purge_deleted_videos`` removes the stale USB-side row.

This module is kept for backwards compatibility with the public API
that callers still depend on:

* ``start_archive_timer()`` / ``stop_archive_timer()`` —
  ``web_control.startup`` / shutdown handlers; delegate to the worker.
* ``trigger_archive_now()`` — ``POST /api/recent_archive/trigger``
  (the NM dispatcher's WiFi-up entry point) and ``base.html`` /
  ``index.html`` UI buttons. Wakes the worker.
* ``get_archive_status()`` — ``GET /api/recent_archive/status``
  (polled by the NM dispatcher to know when archiving has drained
  before triggering cloud sync). Bridges to ``archive_worker.get_status``.
* ``trigger_archive_cleanup()`` — ``POST /cloud/api/archive_cleanup``
  legacy endpoint; one-line wrapper for
  ``archive_watchdog.force_prune_now``. New callers should use
  ``POST /api/archive/prune_now`` directly.

This module should NOT grow. Anything new belongs in ``archive_worker``,
``archive_watchdog``, or ``archive_queue``.
