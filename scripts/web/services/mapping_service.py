TeslaUSB Mapping & Geo-Indexer Service.

Manages a SQLite database of GPS waypoints, trips, and detected driving events

# ±0.05 m/s² and steering can show ±0.1° from sensor jitter. Without an
# absolute-tolerance check, a parked-car Sentry event (10 000+ waypoints
# in a single day) ends up with one ``waypoints_cold`` row per waypoint,
# defeating the entire reason for the hot/cold split. The thresholds
# below are calibrated to be well below any real driving maneuver while
# above the documented sensor noise floor.
#
# These constants are also used by the v14→v15 migration WHERE clause in
# ``mapping_migrations._migrate_v14_to_v15`` so backfill semantics match
# the runtime path exactly. If you change a value here, change the

#  * 'PARK'    — vehicle is stationary; every Sentry/Saved event clip
#    on a parked car carries gear='PARK' for all 30 Hz × 60 s = 1 800
#    waypoints. Recording 1 800 identical "still parked" cold rows per

    This is the runtime defense against trip fragmentation when the
    indexer processes a drive's clips out of order. The matching SQL in
    :func:`_index_video` picks one trip per insert; this helper runs
    afterwards and stitches together any trips the new clip's waypoints
    bridged. Mirrors the v2→v3 migration's merge phase but is scoped to
    one anchor's neighbourhood per call so it costs only a handful of
    queries per indexed file.

    anchor is the lowest-id trip in its merged cluster, otherwise the
    smaller id of the merge pair).

    Important: the caller is responsible for calling ``conn.commit()``
    after this returns. The helper writes through the connection's
    current transaction so insert + merge + stats recompute remain
    atomic — readers see either the pre-insert state or the fully
    merged state, never a half-merged window.

    Foreign-key safety: the schema declares
    ``trip_id REFERENCES trips(id) ON DELETE CASCADE`` on both

       creation_time field in proper UTC, populated from the GPS
       satellite clock — this is independent of the car's onboard

       lost GPS time sync after a firmware update), the filename

       Converted to naive local time so the rest of the pipeline

    Tesla writes to the USB image through the gadget while the Pi has a
    read-only mount of the same image; the kernel's dentry + inode cache
    on the Pi side hides those new files from ``readdir`` until evicted.

    This used to ``umount + mount -o ro`` the RO mount to force the
    eviction (issue #127) — but per ``.github/copilot-instructions.md``
    that's forbidden: any disruption of the present-mode RO mount can
    race with Tesla's gadget reads and produce a transient I/O error,
    losing footage if Tesla is actively recording.

    The kernel-supported replacement is ``echo 2 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches``
    (slabs only — dentry + inode cache). It is sub-10ms, idempotent, and
    does NOT touch the mount, loop device, image file, or gadget
    binding. After the slab eviction, the next ``open`` / ``readdir``
    re-resolves through the loop device and sees Tesla's freshly-written
    metadata.

    The ``current_mode() != 'present'`` early return is preserved: in
    edit mode the local mount IS the write path, so the cache is fresh
    by definition and the call is a no-op.

    The Phase 2b indexer-side catch-up scanner. Walks ONLY the SD-card
    ``ArchivedClips`` tree — never the RO USB mount. The
    ``archive_producer`` thread (issue #76 Phase 2a) handles USB-side
    catch-up by enqueueing into ``archive_queue``; the
    ``archive_worker`` then copies them into ArchivedClips, where this
    helper picks them up if the indexer happened to be down at the
    moment of the worker's enqueue.

    Yields the same flat-files-then-event-subfolders order as
    :func:`_find_front_camera_videos`'s ArchivedClips section, plus
    any nested SavedClips/SentryClips that an operator may have
    rsync'd into the archive directory directly.

    The video file is the playback source — it is NOT the trip itself.
    A user's GPS history (waypoints), trip aggregates (trips), and
    detected events are independent records that must survive video
    loss. This function therefore:

    * **Deletes** the orphan ``indexed_files`` row (the file is gone, so
      the row is lying about indexing state).
    * **NULLs out** ``waypoints.video_path`` and
      ``detected_events.video_path`` for the missing clip — preserving
      the GPS coordinates, telemetry, and event detections while
      signaling to the UI that the playback link is broken.
    * **Never deletes** waypoints, detected_events, or trips.

    This contract is intentional and load-bearing. Earlier behavior
    cascade-deleted trips when their last waypoint was purged, which
    caused real driving history to disappear from the map every time
    the stale-scan caught up to RecentClips files Tesla had rotated
    out before the archive subsystem copied them to SD. See PR
    discussion on issue #75 / #76.

    If a user really wants to forget a trip, that needs to be a
    separate, explicit "Delete Trip" action — not a side effect of a
    background filesystem reconciliation.

    Two modes:

    * **Targeted**: pass ``deleted_paths`` (list of absolute or
      relative video paths) to reconcile only those specific entries.
    * **Full scan**: pass ``teslacam_path`` to walk every
      ``indexed_files`` entry and reconcile rows whose file no longer
      exists.

    Returns a dict with keys ``purged_files``, ``purged_waypoints``,
    ``purged_events``, ``purged_trips``. The ``waypoints``/``events``
    counts now reflect rows whose ``video_path`` was nulled (not
    deleted); ``purged_trips`` is always 0 and remains in the dict for
    backward compatibility.

    """Diff filesystem vs ``indexed_files`` and enqueue any orphans.

    **Phase 2b (issue #76)**: This walks ONLY ``ARCHIVE_DIR``
    (``~/ArchivedClips``). The ``archive_producer`` thread handles
    USB-side catch-up by enqueueing into ``archive_queue``; the
    ``archive_worker`` then copies clips into ArchivedClips, where
    this scan picks them up if the indexer happened to be down at the
    moment of the worker's enqueue (e.g. a manual scp landed a clip
    while ``gadget_web`` was restarting).

    **Phase E (issue #184 Wave 2)**: A persistent watermark
    (``kv_meta.boot_catchup_archived_max_mtime``) records the highest
    file mtime seen by any prior run. The walker stat()s every file
    (a cheap inode read) but only does the canonical_key + DB-lookup
    + enqueue work for files newer than the watermark. The first run
    after upgrade still pays the full cost, but every subsequent boot
    drops to O(new files) — typically zero work because the file
    watcher already handled real-time arrivals.

    The ``teslacam_path`` parameter is accepted for backward
    compatibility but is **ignored** — there is intentionally no path
    from this function to the RO USB mount any more.

    Returns ``{scanned, already_indexed, enqueued, skipped_by_watermark}``.
    The ``active_file`` banner stays off during this call (no
    parsing); the banner only lights up when the worker actually
    picks up an orphan.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Independent safety net for the case where ``purge_deleted_videos`` calls
# from the watcher / archive-retention paths missed something. Iterates
# every ``indexed_files`` row, ``os.path.isfile`` checks each, and removes
# rows whose underlying file no longer exists.
#
# **Initial delay (issue #75):** First fire is scheduled 5–10 min after
# boot — short enough that orphans left behind by the previous boot
# (e.g. files Tesla rotated out of RecentClips while the Pi was off)
# get cleaned up before the user opens the map page, but long enough
# that boot-time IO doesn't compete with USB gadget presentation.
#
# **Cadence (issue #184 Wave 2 — Phase F):** Subsequent fires happen
# ~monthly (was: daily) with jitter so multiple Pis don't hammer the
# same minute. The watcher's per-delete callback is the real-time
# cleanup path — it stat()s nothing, just deletes the row whose
# canonical_key was just removed. The periodic sweep is the safety
# net for the rare case where a delete happened while gadget_web
# was down (e.g., the user copied an SD-card image off the Pi or a
# manual ``rm`` happened over SSH); for a 10k-clip install this
# cuts ``os.path.isfile`` syscalls from 10,000/day → 10,000/month
# (~30× reduction). Out-of-cycle scans can be triggered with
# :func:`trigger_stale_scan_now` from high-signal events (after each
# archive cycle, on the first map page load after a restart, when
# disk-space drops to ``critical``, or when the user clicks a
