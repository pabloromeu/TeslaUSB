TeslaUSB Mapping & Geo-Indexer Service.

Manages a SQLite database of GPS waypoints, trips, and detected driving events

rule-based event detection.

Designed for Pi Zero 2 W: processes one video at a time, uses generators,

    This is the runtime defense against trip fragmentation when the
    indexer processes a drive's clips out of order. The matching SQL in
    :func:`_index_video` picks one trip per insert; this helper runs
    afterwards and stitches together any trips the new clip's waypoints
    bridged. Mirrors the v2→v3 migration's merge phase but is scoped to
    one anchor's neighbourhood per call so it costs only a handful of
    queries per indexed file.

    Returns the surviving trip id (which equals ``anchor_trip_id`` when
    anchor is the lowest-id trip in its merged cluster, otherwise the
    smaller id of the merge pair).

    Important: the caller is responsible for calling ``conn.commit()``
    after this returns. The helper writes through the connection's
    current transaction so insert + merge + stats recompute remain
    atomic — readers see either the pre-insert state or the fully
    merged state, never a half-merged window.

    Foreign-key safety: the schema declares
    ``trip_id REFERENCES trips(id) ON DELETE CASCADE`` on both
    ``waypoints`` and ``detected_events``, so this helper MUST update
    the child rows BEFORE deleting the dropped trip — otherwise the

    ``date_str`` must be ISO ``YYYY-MM-DD``; the caller is expected
    to validate the format before calling. Day-bucketing is by
    ``substr(start_time, 1, 10)`` — a midnight-spanning trip belongs
    to the day it started, not the day it ended (matches
    :func:`query_days`).

    Returns ``{'trips': [...]}`` where each trip has the same
    metadata fields as :func:`query_trips` plus a ``waypoints`` list
    sorted by ``timestamp ASC`` (with ``id ASC`` as a tiebreaker).
    Sorting by id alone is NOT sufficient: when the v2->v3 trip-
    merge migration combines two originally-separate trips, or when
    a late-arriving video gets indexed into an existing trip (boot
    catch-up scan, file watcher, ArchivedClips re-discovery), the
    new waypoints land with higher ids but their timestamps fall in
    the middle of the existing trip's time range. Walking those in
    id-order draws long straight diagonals across the map. Sorting
    by timestamp restores the true chronological sequence.

    Waypoints are NOT post-processed — callers (i.e. the blueprint)
    are responsible for path normalization (``ArchivedClips`` prefix
    stripping) so the service stays free of presentation concerns.

    Performance: one INNER JOIN; ``idx_trips_day`` (expression index
    on ``substr(start_time, 1, 10)``, schema v8) makes the date filter
    O(log n), then ``idx_waypoints_trip`` covers the join. All trip
    waypoints come back in one round trip, then we group in Python.
    For the worst-case 10-trip day with 500 waypoints each (5000
    rows), this is well under 100 ms on a Pi Zero 2 W.

    Trips with zero waypoints are excluded by the INNER JOIN —
    those wouldn't render on the map anyway. The day card's
    ``trip_count`` from :func:`query_days` may therefore exceed
    ``len(result['trips'])`` if some trips were drift artifacts
    with no GPS — that's surfaced in the UI as expected.

    """Return every indexed trip with shape-aware simplified
    waypoints for the "All time" map overview.

    Each trip's waypoints are simplified using the Ramer-Douglas-
    Peucker algorithm (:func:`_simplify_polyline_rdp`) with
    ``epsilon_m`` as the per-point perpendicular-distance tolerance
    (default 8 m, which is above typical GPS noise yet tight enough
    that any road feature is visually preserved at any zoom). The
    earlier stride-sampling implementation cut straight across road
    curves between kept points, producing visibly wrong polylines on
    long trips — RDP fixes that by keeping the points whose
    perpendicular distance to the simplified path exceeds the
    tolerance, so corners survive and straight stretches collapse
    naturally.

    ``max_points_per_trip`` (default 200) is a safety cap applied
    after RDP; only pathologically zigzag trips would ever hit it.
    Trips below ``min_distance_km`` and trips with fewer than 2
    valid waypoints are excluded — same parity guarantees as
    :func:`query_trips` and :func:`query_day_routes`.

    Returns trips ordered by ``start_time`` DESC. Each trip carries
    enough metadata for the client to drill into the correct day on
    polyline click (``date``) plus the simplified waypoint list
    (only ``lat``, ``lon``, ``speed_mps`` — per-clip drilldown is
    delegated to :func:`query_day_routes` when the user opens a day).

    Performance: one SQL round trip fetches every waypoint for every
    qualifying trip; RDP per trip is O(n log n) on average (O(n^2)
    worst case for pathological zigzags). For a 22-trip / ~10k-
    waypoint database this returns in ~150 ms on a Pi Zero 2 W,
    producing ~30 points per typical trip — substantially fewer
    points than the old stride sampler AND a visually correct
    polyline.
