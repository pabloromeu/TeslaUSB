"""Single-threaded indexing worker.

Drains the ``indexing_queue`` table one file at a time, with low OS
priority and gentle inter-file pauses so the gadget and Flask UI stay
responsive on the Pi Zero 2 W.

Public API (called from ``web_control.py``, ``mode_control.py``, and
the ``/api/index/status`` endpoint)::

    start_worker(db_path, teslacam_root)
    stop_worker(timeout=15)
    pause_worker(timeout=15) -> bool       # True if worker became idle
    resume_worker()
    get_worker_status() -> dict            # for status API + UI banner
    is_paused() -> bool

UI banner rule: show whenever ``status['active_file']`` is truthy.

Lifecycle invariants
--------------------
* Exactly one worker thread is alive between ``start_worker`` and
  ``stop_worker``. ``start_worker`` is idempotent.
* Pause is cooperative: the worker observes ``_pause_event`` only at
  iteration boundaries (before claiming a new file). When mid-file,
  the in-flight file always finishes before pause takes effect.
* Every claim is owner-guarded. If the worker thread dies or stalls,
  ``recover_stale_claims`` releases its rows after 30 minutes; the
  fresh worker won't accidentally clobber a still-running predecessor
  thanks to ``claimed_by`` + ``claimed_at`` guards on
  complete/release/defer.

      per-task; we pass ``threading.get_native_id()`` so the I/O-idle
      class applies to the indexer thread only, not to the Flask
      handler thread that happens to be processing a request when
