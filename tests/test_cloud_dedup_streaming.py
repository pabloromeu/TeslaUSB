"""Phase 5.3 — cloud-dedup streaming regression tests.

These tests pin the contract of ``_is_path_skipped`` and verify that
``_discover_events`` no longer loads the entire ``cloud_synced_files``
table into memory.

The legacy implementation:

    rows = conn.execute(
        "SELECT file_path FROM cloud_synced_files "
        "WHERE status IN ('synced', 'dead_letter')"
    ).fetchall()
    synced_paths = {r["file_path"] for r in rows}

…allocated O(N) memory at the start of every discover pass even when
only a handful of new events were on disk. On a year-old database the
set would routinely cross ~8 MB. The Phase 5.3 streaming version
replaces this with one indexed point-lookup per candidate event so the
peak memory is bounded by the number of NEW events, not by the cloud
history.

The tests below cover:

* per-row semantics for both ``synced`` and ``dead_letter`` (skip)
* per-row semantics for ``pending`` / ``failed`` (don't skip)
* legacy "no connection" behaviour (returns False — don't filter)
* exception safety (DB error → False, picker continues)
* indexed lookup (verified by EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN — must use the unique
  index on ``file_path``, not a full table scan)
* end-to-end: ``_discover_events`` actually skips synced/dead_letter rows
  and includes pending/unknown ones
* bounded-memory guard: ``_discover_events`` never loads the whole
  ``cloud_synced_files`` table — verified by tracing ``conn.execute``
  and asserting no ``SELECT file_path FROM cloud_synced_files`` (the
  bulk-load shape) is ever issued
