"""Tests for issue #184 Wave 3 — Phase D (hot/cold waypoints split).

Covers:

* The v14 → v15 migration backfills cold telemetry from existing
  ``waypoints`` rows into the new ``waypoints_cold`` table and then
  drops the cold columns from ``waypoints``.
* Idempotency: re-running the migration on an already-v15 DB is a
  no-op.
* The runtime ``_index_video`` writer obeys the same default-only
  filter as the migration (parked-car waypoints don't bloat
  ``waypoints_cold``).
* The new ``query_trip_telemetry`` helper joins ``waypoints_cold``
  back to ``waypoints`` and returns a dict keyed by waypoint id.
* The lazy-loaded ``GET /api/trip/<id>/telemetry`` blueprint route
  returns the same shape and is gated on ``IMG_CAM_PATH``.
* ``query_trip_route`` no longer surfaces cold columns (they were
  the bulk of the per-row payload — this is the read-path saving
  the redesign exists to deliver).

These tests exist to prevent a regression that re-introduces cold
columns onto the hot table or causes the migration to lose data
on upgrade.
