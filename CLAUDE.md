# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

> **⚠️ Living document rule**: Any architectural decision, layout choice, or configuration choice made during development or setup sessions **must be recorded here** before the session ends. This file is the single source of truth for why things are the way they are.

## Project Overview

TeslaUSB transforms a Raspberry Pi into a smart USB drive for Tesla dashcam recordings. It presents two or three USB mass storage LUNs to the vehicle (TeslaCam, LightShow, optional Music) while running a Flask web dashboard with GPS mapping, telemetry HUD, cloud sync, and media management.

Target hardware: **Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W** (512MB RAM). Every design decision — memory, CPU, no JS frameworks, no CDN calls — must account for this constraint.

## Fork & Upstream Relationship

This repo (`pabloromeu/TeslaUSB`) is a personal fork of `mphacker/TeslaUSB` (remote: `upstream`).

- Sync upstream changes: `git fetch upstream && git log --oneline upstream/main ^main` to review, then merge or cherry-pick selectively.
- **Do not run `upgrade.sh`** — it is hardcoded to pull from `mphacker/TeslaUSB` and will overwrite fork-specific changes.
- Before merging upstream, always review `scripts/wifi-monitor.sh` separately — the AP interface approach differs (see WiFi section below).
- The Pi is a git clone of this fork. Config values specific to this device (`target_user`, partition sizes) are committed in `config.yaml`. A full backup of the Pi's config is at `.local/config.pi.yaml` (gitignored).

## Common Commands

### Updating the Pi

```bash
# SSH into Pi
ssh pablo@teslausb.local

# Pull latest code
cd ~/TeslaUSB && git pull

# For Python/template-only changes (most common)
sudo systemctl restart gadget_web.service wifi-monitor.service

# For systemd unit or bash script changes
sudo bash ~/TeslaUSB/setup_usb.sh   # select option 2 to keep existing images
```

### Development (on the Pi)

```bash
# Run web app manually
cd /home/pablo/TeslaUSB && python3 scripts/web/web_control.py

# View web service logs
sudo journalctl -u gadget_web.service -f
sudo journalctl -u wifi-monitor.service -f

# Restart web service after Python changes
sudo systemctl restart gadget_web.service

# Restart AP/WiFi service after config changes
sudo systemctl restart wifi-monitor.service

# Switch operating modes
sudo bash ~/TeslaUSB/scripts/present_usb.sh   # Connect to Tesla (Present mode)
sudo bash ~/TeslaUSB/scripts/edit_usb.sh      # Enable network sharing (Edit mode)
```

### Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run a single test file
pytest tests/test_mapping_service.py

# Run a single test
pytest tests/test_sei_parser.py::test_function_name
```

### Setup & Deployment

```bash
# Full install/re-deploy (after changing templates or scripts/)
# Run on the Pi, select option 2 to keep existing images
sudo bash ~/TeslaUSB/setup_usb.sh
```

## Architecture

### Configuration System

- **Single source of truth**: `config.yaml` at repo root — all paths, credentials, and settings live here.
- **Bash scripts** read config via `scripts/config.sh` (uses `yq` with a single optimized eval call).
- **Python** reads config via `scripts/web/config.py` (uses PyYAML).
- Never hardcode paths or values; always use these wrappers.
- After editing `config.yaml`, restart `gadget_web.service` (web changes) or `wifi-monitor.service` (AP changes).

### Template System

- Source files in `scripts/` and `templates/` use placeholders: `__GADGET_DIR__`, `__MNT_DIR__`, `__TARGET_USER__`, `__IMG_NAME__`, `__SECRET_KEY__`.
- Run `sudo ./setup_usb.sh` after changing any template to substitute and deploy. Never hardcode installed paths.

### Operating Modes

- **Present mode** (default on boot): USB gadget active, drives RO-mounted at `/mnt/gadget/part*-ro`, Samba off.
- **Edit mode**: Gadget off, drives RW-mounted at `/mnt/gadget/part*`, Samba on.
- Current mode stored in `state.txt`; `mode_service.current_mode()` falls back to detection.
- **Boot priority**: USB gadget presentation to Tesla is #1. Never add blocking work before UDC bind in `present_usb.sh`. All post-boot tasks (cleanup, chime selection, indexing, cloud sync) run via `teslausb-deferred-tasks.service`.

### Flask Web App (`scripts/web/`)

- Entry point: `web_control.py` — creates Flask app, registers all blueprints.
- **Blueprints** (`blueprints/`): one per feature area (mapping, videos, lock_chimes, light_shows, music, wraps, license_plates, media, analytics, cleanup, cloud_archive, api, fsck, captive_portal, mode_control).
- **Services** (`services/`): all business logic — mount handling, file ops, chimes, thumbnails, Samba, mode detection, geo-indexing, cloud sync, etc.
- **Helpers** (`helpers/`): config_updater, refresh_cloud_token, safe_mode.
- Blueprints are always registered — routes redirect when their required `.img` file is missing (never unregistered at import time).

### Feature Gating (Image-Gated UI)

Nav items and routes are hidden/blocked when the required disk image doesn't exist:

- `usb_cam.img` → analytics, videos, cleanup sub-pages
- `usb_lightshow.img` → chimes, light shows, wraps, license_plates
- `usb_music.img` + `MUSIC_ENABLED` → music

`partition_service.get_feature_availability()` returns a dict of booleans; `utils.get_base_context()` merges them into every template context; `base.html` wraps nav links in `{% if <flag> %}` guards. Each gated blueprint has a `@bp.before_request` hook — AJAX requests get 503 JSON, normal requests redirect to Settings with a flash.

**When adding a new gated feature**: add to `get_feature_availability()`, guard nav link in `base.html`, add `@bp.before_request` in the blueprint.

### Mount / Gadget Safety Rules

- All mount/umount commands must run in PID 1 mount namespace: `sudo nsenter --mount=/proc/1/ns/mnt ...`
- Resolve paths via `partition_service.get_mount_path()` / `iter_all_partitions()` — never hardcode.
- `partition_mount_service.quick_edit_part2` temporarily remounts part2 RW in present mode (uses `.quick_edit_part2.lock`, 120s stale). Always restore RO mount and LUN on all code paths including failures.
- **quick_edit_part2 sequence**: Clear LUN1 backing → unmount RO → detach loops → create RW loop → mount RW → do work → sync → unmount → detach → create RO loop → remount RO → restore LUN1 backing.
- USB gadget serves the `.img` file directly as the LUN backing file — not loop devices. Loop devices are for local mounting only.

### Lock Chimes

- Rules: WAV <1 MiB, 16-bit PCM, 44.1/48 kHz, mono/stereo. `lock_chime_service` validates, re-encodes via ffmpeg if needed.
- After replacing `LockChime.wav`, MUST rebind USB gadget (`partition_mount_service.rebind_usb_gadget()`) to force Tesla cache invalidation.
- Present-mode uploads use `quick_edit_part2`; keep operations short and atomic (temp + fsync + MD5).
- Boot optimization: `select_random_chime.py` passes `skip_quick_edit=True` when part2 is already RW-mounted at boot.

### Video & Mapping

- **No standalone Videos page.** All video browsing is in the map page (`mapping.html`) via a slide-out panel.
- GPS/telemetry indexed from dashcam SEI metadata by `mapping_service.py` into `geodata.db` (SQLite).
- **Queue-based indexing** (as of 2026-05-07 upstream merge): `indexing_worker.py` drains an `indexing_queue` table one file at a time with 250ms inter-file pauses. Producers call `enqueue_for_indexing()` / `enqueue_many_for_indexing()`. `config.yaml` keys `index_on_startup` and `index_on_mode_switch` are deprecated no-ops — the queue handles this automatically.
- File watcher calls `enqueue_many_for_indexing()` on new files and `purge_deleted_videos()` on deletions. The purge checks whether an archived copy still exists before removing DB rows.
- **No thumbnail system** — it has been removed. Never add thumbnail generation.
- `file_watcher_service.py` uses `watchdog` (inotify) with 5-minute polling fallback.

### Cloud Sync

- Queue-based (SQLite), one file at a time, `nice -n 19` + `ionice -c3` on rclone.
- Priority: Tesla event.json folders → geolocated trips → other clips (opt-in).
- Mark file as `synced` only AFTER rclone confirms upload + DB commit + fsync.

### Task Coordinator

- `task_coordinator.py` enforces exclusive lock: geo-indexer, video archiver, and cloud sync never run simultaneously (critical for 512MB RAM).

### Offline Access Point & Captive Portal

- AP runs on virtual interface `uap0` concurrent with WiFi client on `wlan0`.
- Three force modes: `auto`, `force_on`, `force_off` — persisted in `config.yaml` and runtime file `/run/teslausb-ap/force.mode`.
- Captive portal: Flask blueprint intercepts OS connectivity check URLs; dnsmasq spoofs all DNS to gateway IP. Port 80 is required — no iptables redirects.
- `http://teslausb/` is a dnsmasq alias for the AP gateway — resolves to 192.168.4.1.

#### WiFi AP Architecture Decision (2026-05-07)

We use the **uap0 virtual interface approach** (upstream default). An earlier fork used wlan0-direct (hostapd took full control of wlan0, NM set to unmanaged) which gave better AP TCP stability but made WiFi reconnection harder to debug. We switched back because the main pain point was reconnection failure, not AP instability.

**Known trade-off**: on Pi Zero 2 W (single-radio brcmfmac), uap0 still locks the radio to the AP channel, so wlan0 cannot associate on a different channel while the AP is up. The periodic STA retry (every ~2 min, 30-second poll window) is the only reconnection path while the AP is active.

**Bugs fixed in `wifi-monitor.sh` (2026-05-07)**:
- `local active_conn` outside a function (line ~500) — `local` is invalid outside bash functions, silently made the last-resort `nmcli connection up` dead code. Fixed by removing the `local` keyword.
- If reverting to wlan0-direct: the recovery block uses `awk -v if="$WIFI_IF"` — `if` is a reserved keyword in mawk (Pi default). Use a different variable name (e.g. `iface`) or the recovery block silently never fires.

### Services & Timers (systemd)

- `gadget_web.service` — Flask web UI
- `present_usb_on_boot.service` — presents USB gadget at boot
- `teslausb-deferred-tasks.service` — post-boot: cleanup, chime selection, indexing, cloud sync
- `chime_scheduler.timer` — checks scheduled chime changes every 60s
- `wifi-monitor.service` — manages AP/STA roaming
- `watchdog.service` — hardware watchdog (15s timeout)

## UI/UX Rules

Full design system: [`docs/UI_UX_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`](docs/UI_UX_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md)

- **No emoji icons** — use Lucide SVG icons exclusively.
- **CSS tokens only** — never hardcode hex values; use `--bg-primary`, `--accent-success`, etc.
- **Dark and light mode**: both must work; test both. Use `[data-theme="dark"]` selectors.
- **Mobile-first**: bottom tab bar (<1024px), sidebar rail (>=1024px). Test at 375px and 1024px+.
- **Touch targets**: minimum 44x44px.
- **No "Edit Mode" / "Present Mode" in UI** — user-facing concept is "Network File Sharing". Show a status dot.
- **No external CDN calls** — fonts, icons, and all assets must be bundled locally.
- **Progressive disclosure**: Layer 1 (glanceable), Layer 2 (one tap), Layer 3 (deliberate action).

## Pitfalls

- Skipping `nsenter` for mounts — mounts vanish after subprocess exit.
- Wrong unbind/mount order when leaving present mode — causes busy unmounts.
- Editing templates without rerunning `setup_usb.sh` — placeholders stay unexpanded.
- Long `quick_edit` operations leaving LUN unbound on failure — always restore on all code paths.
- Adding blocking work before UDC bind in `present_usb.sh` — delays Tesla USB detection.
- Adding a new blueprint route without a `before_request` image guard when the feature requires a disk image.
- Marking a cloud file as `synced` before rclone confirms the upload.
- Running rclone without `nice`/`ionice` — starves the web server.
- Generating video thumbnails (system removed — don't add it back).
- Deleting or overwriting `*.img` files — `is_protected_file()` guard must always be respected.

## Partition Layout & Content Decisions

These decisions were made during the initial setup session (2026-04-29) and must not be changed without updating this file.

### USB LUN layout

| LUN | Image               | Format | What goes here                                                                                                                           |
| --- | ------------------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0   | `usb_cam.img`       | exFAT  | TeslaCam dashcam + Sentry recordings (Tesla writes here automatically)                                                                   |
| 1   | `usb_lightshow.img` | FAT32  | **Light shows only** — `/LightShow/*.fseq` + paired audio. Also `/Chimes/`, `/Wrap/`, and `/LicensePlate/` managed by TeslaUSB web UI   |
| 2   | `usb_music.img`     | FAT32  | Music files + **`/Boombox/` folder** for Tesla Boombox horn sounds                                                                      |

### Content placement rules

- **Light shows** (`.fseq` + `.mp3`/`.wav` pairs) → LUN 1 `/LightShow/`
- **Lock chimes** → LUN 1 `/Chimes/` — managed by TeslaUSB web UI (upload, preview, scheduler)
- **Wraps** (PNG files for Tesla Paint Shop) → LUN 1 `/Wrap/` — managed by TeslaUSB web UI
- **License plates** (PNG images, 420x100px recommended) → LUN 1 `/LicensePlate/` — managed by TeslaUSB web UI (upload, download, delete; up to 10 images)
- **Boombox sounds** → LUN 2 `/Boombox/` — Tesla reads this folder natively; managed by the **Boombox blueprint** (`blueprints/boombox.py`, `services/boombox_service.py`). Upload/delete/preview via the web UI (Media Hub → Boombox tab). MP3 only, max 1 MiB per file, max 20 files. Uses `quick_edit_part3` in present mode. **Note**: the old fork used `/Media/` — files were migrated to `/Boombox/` on 2026-05-07.
- **Music** → LUN 2 root or subfolders — Tesla music player reads from here

### Why Boombox lives on LUN 2 (Music), not LUN 1 (LightShow)

Tesla reads Boombox sounds from a `/Boombox/` folder on any connected USB drive. Placing it on LUN 2 (Music) keeps LUN 1 (LightShow) clean — only light shows, chimes, and wraps that TeslaUSB actively manages. This avoids confusion between Tesla-native media features and TeslaUSB-managed features.

**Do not** put Boombox sounds, raw chime files, or wrap PNGs directly on the LightShow partition outside of the folders TeslaUSB manages (`/Chimes/`, `/Wrap/`, `/LightShow/`, `/LicensePlate/`).

### Partition sizes (actual — this device)

| Partition  | Size   | Rationale                                                 |
| ---------- | ------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| TeslaCam   | 64 GB  | Dashcam + sentry storage                                  |
| LightShow  | 8 GB   | Shows, chimes, wraps, license plates                      |
| Music      | 512 MB | Boombox sounds only (no music library)                    |
| SD reserve | 5 GB   | Keep filesystem healthy                                   |

## Workspace Rules

- **Never install packages or node_modules inside the git repo.** Test tooling (Playwright, npm packages) must live outside — use `../playwright-test/` or similar.
- **Never create temporary test/debug/scratch files inside the repo.** Put them in a parent directory.
- **The git working tree must stay clean.** After any task, `git status` should show only intentional changes.
- **Python `__pycache__/`** is gitignored — never commit `.pyc` files.
